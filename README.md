# Unity-Number-Guesser
I recently started learning to use Unity to create 2D games, and this is one of my first attempts at a really simple, number guessing game. 

So far Unity has been interesting to learn, and I think I might enjoy game development in the future, which is why I wanted to try and teach myself how to use Unity.
